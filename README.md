changeMACAddress
================

This is a script for changing a network adapter's MAC address. Support is for Windows XP or later. 

### How to Use

By default, `changeMACAddress.exe` modifies the MAC address of the network adapter that currently has a connection, so make sure you are connected to the internet before it is used. Alternatively, you can specify the name of the adapter you want to change with

`changeMACAddress.exe -name <insert name here>`

and the `.exe` will change the MAC address for that device.
